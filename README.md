# S-L_Interface_Properties
A repository of all my programs to calculate the solid-liquid interfacial properties. 
All code and programs were used to develop my programming skills and learn new topics. 

GCN folder contains a file that calculates the generalised coordination number of metal atoms on a metal slab. 
The coordination number file can also be found here. 

The Water-Solid Properties folder contains many of the orientation and distance programs I developed.
